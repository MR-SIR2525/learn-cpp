 * Student name: Andrew Blythe
 * Program name: Pizza Pi (70110) - Prog Assignment
 * Program Instructions: 
 * Joeâ€™s Pizza Palace needs a program to calculate the number of slices a pizza of any size 
 * can be divided into. The program should perform the following steps:
 *      - Ask the user for the diameter of the pizza in inches.
 *      - Calculate the number of slices that may be taken from a pizza of that size
 *      - Display a message telling the number of slices.
 *      
 * To calculate the number of slices that may be taken from the pizza, you must know the 
 * following facts:
 *      - Each slice should have an area of 14.125 square inches.
 *      - To calculate the number of slices, simply divide the area of the pizza by 14.125.
 *      - The area of the pizza is calculated with this formula: Area = "pi r squared" 
 *        where pi is approximately 3.14159 and r is the radius (half the the diameter).
