 * Student name: Andrew Blythe
 * Program name: Ocean Levels
 * Program description: The Earthâ€™s ocean levels have risen an average of 1.8 millimeters per 
 *                      year over the past century. This program computes and displays the
 *                      number of centimeters and number of inches the oceans rose during 
 *                      this time. One millimeter is equivalent to 0.1 centimeters. 
 *                      One centimeter is equivalent to 0.3937 inches.
